---
### Monolith
- Single Codebase, single deployment.
- All the modules are tightly coupled.
- Single point of failure.
- Difficult Scalability, as you can not scale individual modules independently.
- Hard to maintain if different teams are working on different modules.

### Microservices
- Multiple independent services.
- Independent deployment for each module.
- Teams can focus on their modules independently.
- Easy scalability.
- More resilient as no single point of failure exists.
